# Arduino_Mega_Ultrasonic_LCD_Distance_Indicator
This uses Arduino MEGA connected to a Ultrasonic sensor and and I2C LCD screen to display distance from the sensor
This code will check distance and indicate if an obstacle/person is away for 5 seconds from a fixed distance ( it is set at 50cm here). Three LEDs indicate status for Present, Away (for 5 secnods) and Absent (when away for more than 5 seconds)
Items needed are Arduino MEGA 2560, Ultrasonic sensor HC SR04, beardboard, resistors for the LED
The code is mish mash of publicly avaiable code and i dont claim it as mine. Anyone can re-use the code
